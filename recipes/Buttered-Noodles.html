    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs.
        Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh
        herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions
        on how to make it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><Strong>Noodles</Strong>: This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
            <li><Strong>Butter</Strong>: You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
            <li><Strong>Parmesan</Strong>: Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
            <li><Strong>Salt and Pepper</Strong>: Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot.
            </li>
            <li>Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.</li>
        </ol>
