    <!-- Description -->
    <p>
        This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread 
        crumb topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy to make<br> the cheese 
        sauce from scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding 
        milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a<br> rich, decadent sauce that 
        coats every nook and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food 
        macaroni and cheese casserole<br> with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried 
        chicken or alongside a salad for a meatless dinner.

    <!-- Steps -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the noodles</strong>: Boil the macaroni in salted water until the 
                noodles are al dente. Drain and transfer to a prepared <br>baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the cheese sauce</strong>: Melt butter, then whisk in the flour. 
                Whisk in the milk, bring to a simmer, and stir in the <br>cheeses. Season with salt 
                and pepper and continue simmering until the sauce is thick. Pour the sauce over the<br> 
                noodles and stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the topping</strong>: Melt two tablespoons of butter in a skillet, add 
                the bread crumbs, and toast until the crumbs are<br> brown. Spread the topping over the macaroni 
                and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake the mac and cheese</strong>: Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is golden brown.
                At 350 degrees F, this <br>macaroni and cheese should be perfectly golden brown and gooey after about 30 minutes.
